Pqr example files necessary to use the method for the Calculation of the contributions to the Electrostatic Free Energy
This example corresponds to the WT Spike at a distance of XX reported in Section 3.1 in the main paper.

- Auxiliary I system: WT Spike and planar surface with no charge
- Auxiliary II system: WT Spike with no charge and charged planar surface
- Reference system calculation: WT Spike and a negatively charged surface with a density charge of $$-1e/\text{nm}^2$$
